#![no_std]

//! Tholos v2: stake-weighted resolution. Design in `docs/src/V2_RESOLUTION.md`.
//! Deployed as a wholly separate contract from v1 (`contracts/tholos`), never
//! upgraded in place: see the design doc's "Migration from existing v1
//! deployments" section for why.
//!
//! This crate currently implements #64 (the immutable `PolicySnapshotV2`
//! pinned at assertion creation, and the `AssertionV2` record it lives on),
//! #65 (bonded assertion posting, and the uncontested-finalize path), #66
//! (`dispute` and the third-party registration phase), #67 (the reveal
//! phase and commitment verification), #68 (weighted-majority outcome
//! resolution: the strict-majority lock and optimistic-timeout default),
//! #69 (settlement: converting a locked outcome into per-position
//! entitlements, forfeiture, and pro-rata reward distribution), #70
//! (credit withdrawal and the reentrancy guard on every token-moving
//! entrypoint), #71 (`set_paused_v2` and `cancel_round`, the emergency
//! mechanism for an already-active round, distinct from v1's narrower
//! new-assertions-only pause), and #154 (pinning `admin` in `__constructor`,
//! atomically with contract creation, so a separate `initialize` call can no
//! longer be front-run to claim the admin role). Remaining issues (#72
//! onward) land as this crate grows.
