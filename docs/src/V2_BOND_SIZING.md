# V2 bond sizing and window analysis

This note models the deployment-time choices unique to protocol v2: the
`base_bond` / `min_resolution_bond` floor, the registration and reveal window
lengths, anti-sniping headroom, and the per-address position cap. The models are
not a substitute for live telemetry, but they give deployers a repeatable way to
pick initial values and revisit them as usage changes.

For the v1 bond-sizing framework (spam floors, dispute floors, and finalize-reward
constraints that still apply to `base_bond`) see [BOND_SIZING.md](BOND_SIZING.md).
This document extends that analysis with the three problems that are new in v2.

## Background: v2 outcome rule

Every disputed assertion produces a frozen eligible-weight total `W` at the
registration cutoff. `W` includes the asserter's `base_bond`, the disputer's
`base_bond`, and every third-party position registered before the cutoff.

A side wins by **strict majority**: revealed weight for that side must exceed
`W / 2`. If neither side crosses that threshold when the reveal window closes,
the **optimistic timeout default** applies and the originally asserted outcome
stands.

Settlement differs by terminal cause:

- **Strict majority**: winning positions recover principal and share the losing
  and non-revealed pool pro rata. Losing and non-revealed positions are forfeited.
- **Optimistic timeout**: all revealed positions (on either side) recover principal
  and share only the non-revealed pool. Non-revealed positions are forfeited.

Those two rules make non-revelation a double loss: the non-revealer forfeits its
bond and in a strict-majority scenario, its forfeiture is paid to the winning
side rather than returned to it. Under a timeout default, non-revealers still
forfeit to revealed positions.

## Part 1: default-frequency model

### The core asymmetry

The optimistic timeout assigns the outcome to the asserted side unless a revealed
majority actively overturns it. Non-revealed weight sits in the denominator `W`
but contributes no votes. This means a large pool of registered-but-silent
positions can make an honest majority impossible without being a majority itself.

Formally, let:

- `W` = frozen eligible total
- `F` = revealed weight agreeing with the asserted outcome
- `A` = revealed weight against
- `N` = non-revealed weight (`N = W - F - A`)

The assertion stands whenever `A <= W / 2`. Because `N > 0` inflates `W`, even a
large `A` may not cross the threshold.

### Default-frequency formula

For a dispute where the true outcome is *against* the asserted side, the assertion
nevertheless survives if:

```text
A / W <= 0.5
```

Define `t = (F + A) / W` as the **reveal turnout rate** (fraction of eligible
weight that actually reveals). For a symmetric dispute where roughly half the
revealed weight sides with each party:

```text
A ~= t x W / 2
```

Then the assertion survives if:

```text
t x W / 2 <= W / 2  ->  t <= 1.0
```

That is always true: turnout alone cannot prevent a timeout. The meaningful
question is what reveal turnout `t` is needed for the *against* side to reach a
strict majority when the split of revealed weight is skewed toward the losing
(assertion-supporting) side.

Let `s` be the fraction of revealed weight on the *against* side (honesty
share). A strict-majority against-the-assertion requires:

```text
s x t > 0.5
  ->  t > 0.5 / s
```

| Against-side honesty share `s` | Minimum turnout `t` for correction |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 100% (all revealers disagree)  | > 50%                              |
| 80%                            | > 62.5%                            |
| 66%                            | > 75.8%                            |
| 51%                            | > 98%                              |
| 50%                            | impossible (tie never crosses 50%) |

**Key finding**: when honest disagreers are 66% of revealers, three-quarters of
all eligible weight must reveal for correction. When they are 51%, virtually the
entire pool must reveal. Any non-reveal (absent staking, lost keys, sleeping
coordinators) benefits the asserted outcome.

### The issue-body example

The V2 design discussion raised this scenario explicitly:

> 1% reveals for the assertion, 49% reveals against, 50% does not reveal.

Here `W = 100`, `F = 1`, `A = 49`, `N = 50`. The against-side has 49 units,
but the threshold is `W / 2 = 50`. The assertion stands because `49 < 50`.

More generally, any time `N >= 1` unit makes the strict-majority threshold
unattainable for the against-side, the assertion stands regardless of the
revealed margin. This is the intended behavior: the optimistic default favors the
status quo and treats abstention as implicit delegation to it.

### Implications for window sizing

The default-frequency risk is not eliminated by longer windows; it is controlled
by ensuring that enough bonded capital can *reach* the reveal phase. The levers
are:

1. **`registration_duration_secs`**: a longer window lets more third-party
   positions arrive, growing `W` with counter-stake rather than diluting a small
   `W` with silence.
2. **`reveal_duration_secs`**: a longer reveal window lets coordinators organize
   reveals. Too short a window and registered positions may silently miss it.
3. **`min_resolution_bond` = `base_bond`**: a higher floor means fewer positions
   but each one is more economically committed. It does not by itself prevent
   default.

The practical guard against frequent timeout-by-silence is ensuring that the
*disputer* plus a realistic cohort of third-party registrants can represent a
strict majority of `W`. With only two equal fixed positions (`2 x base_bond`) and
no third parties, `W = 2 x base_bond`, `A = base_bond`, and `A / W = 0.5`; the
disputer's weight never exceeds half. A lone dispute *always* times out unless at
least one additional third party registers on the against side. See Part 3 for the
window-length tradeoffs that govern third-party participation.

## Part 2: whale-capture model

### Definitions

A **whale** is a single address or coalition that can unilaterally reach strict
majority in one dispute. In v2 this means controlling more than `W / 2` of
eligible weight at the registration cutoff.

Because weight is strictly proportional to bonded capital and splitting across
addresses provides no extra weight, the analysis is purely about capital
concentration.

Let:

- `B` = `base_bond` (asserter's and disputer's positions, each)
- `R_w` = whale's registration deposit (one or more top-ups summing to at most
  `max_position`)
- `R_h` = total honest counter-stake registered by non-whale addresses
- `W = 2B + R_w + R_h`

The whale controls strict majority when:

```text
R_w > W / 2
  ->  R_w > (2B + R_w + R_h) / 2
  ->  2R_w > 2B + R_w + R_h
  ->  R_w > 2B + R_h
```

### Concentration threshold

Define `c` as the whale's share of total eligible weight:

```text
c = R_w / W
```

The whale reaches strict majority when `c > 0.5`. But the *cost* to reach that
threshold depends on how much honest counter-stake `R_h` is present:

```text
Minimum R_w for capture = 2B + R_h + 1 unit
```

With zero counter-stake (`R_h = 0`):

```text
R_w > 2B  ->  just over twice the base bond is enough to capture majority
```

With counter-stake equal to the base bond (`R_h = B`):

```text
R_w > 3B  ->  just over three times the base bond required
```

With counter-stake equal to five times the base bond (`R_h = 5B`):

```text
R_w > 7B  ->  just over seven times the base bond required
```

Each additional unit of honest counter-stake raises the whale's capture cost
one-for-one, so growing `W` with genuine third-party positions is the primary
defense.

### Role of `max_position`

Setting `max_position < max_total_weight` prevents a single address from
contributing all of `W`. If `max_position = p x base_bond`:

```text
Maximum single-address weight share = p / (2 + p) when R_h = 0
```

| `max_position` (multiples of `base_bond`) | Max share of W (no counter-stake) |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1x (equal to each fixed party)            | 33%                               |
| 2x                                        | 50% exactly; cannot reach majority |
| 3x                                        | 60%                               |
| 5x                                        | 71%                               |
| 10x                                       | 83%                               |
| unlimited (= `max_total_weight`)          | 100%                              |

**Key finding**: setting `max_position = 2 x base_bond` means a single address
with no counter-stake can only reach exactly 50%, which is not a strict majority.
Setting it at `3 x base_bond` allows capture with no counter-stake. This is the
most impactful single-parameter defense: even if no third party registers,
`max_position <= 2 x base_bond` prevents a whale from reaching majority on its own.

However, `max_position <= 2 x base_bond` also caps legitimate counter-stake, which
means a single large honest voter cannot provide the full majority on its own
either. Whether that is acceptable depends on the deployment's expected electorate
size. For a deployment expecting 3+ participants in a contested dispute, tight
position caps are advisable. For a two-party deployment, the caps may be
irrelevant.

### Self-hedging and the cost illusion

A coalition that controls both the asserter role *and* a whale-sized registration
deposit can attempt to control both the assertion and the majority vote. If the
coalition has asserter position `B` (agreeing) plus registration `R_w > W / 2`
(also agreeing), it controls majority at total cost `B + R_w`. If the honest
side wins instead, the `StrictMajorityAgainst` settlement rule pays only
positions where `agrees_with_outcome == Some(false)`; the asserter's
`Fixed(true)` position has `agrees_with_outcome == Some(true)` and is therefore
forfeited along with `R_w`. The coalition's real net exposure when it loses is
`B + R_w`, not `R_w` alone. There is no self-hedging benefit: the asserter bond
does not reduce the coalition's downside.

A deployer should therefore think of capture cost as **`B + R_w`** in both the
success and the failure case. The minimum capital at risk for a capture attempt
is `B + R_w`, where `R_w > 2B + R_h`. A `max_position` limit forces the whale
to assemble multiple addresses, but linear weight prevents splitting from
amplifying its combined vote; it only complicates logistics and raises capital
requirements slightly.

## Part 3: window-length tradeoff model

### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `T_reg` | `registration_duration_secs` |
| `T_rev` | `reveal_duration_secs` |
| `T_hard` | `anti_snipe_hard_max_secs` |
| `T_ext` | `anti_snipe_extension_secs` |
| `t_react` | Typical time for a new voter to notice the dispute and decide to register |
| `t_coord` | Time needed to coordinate reveals off-chain (signal, salt collection) |
| `t_atk` | Time an attacker needs to move capital into a sniped deposit |

### Registration window: participation vs. capture speed

A longer `T_reg` window increases expected third-party participation by giving
more potential voters time to notice the dispute and post bonds. Every unit of
honest counter-stake `R_h` added during registration raises the whale's capture
cost one-for-one (Part 2). But a longer window also extends the period during
which a well-funded attacker can observe accumulated positions, compute the
remaining gap to majority, and deploy exactly enough capital to cross it at
the last moment.

The tradeoff:

```
Participation benefit peaks when:  T_reg >= t_react (typical voter latency)
Capture risk is manageable when:   T_reg < time attacker needs to move capital
```

For most deployments these are the same order of magnitude (minutes to hours),
which is why anti-sniping exists. The practical guidance:

- Use `T_reg >= t_react` to capture genuine participation.
- Use `T_ext` (anti-snipe extension) to deter last-second position injections
  that arrive after honest voters cannot respond.
- Cap extensions at `T_hard` to prevent an adversary from grieving registration
  by repeatedly triggering extensions.

### Anti-sniping parameters

The soft deadline extends by `T_ext` when a qualifying deposit arrives within
`T_ext` seconds of the current deadline, but can never exceed `T_hard`. The
extension fires repeatedly if deposits keep arriving near the moving edge.

```text
Maximum extensions before hard cap:  floor((T_hard - T_reg) / T_ext)
```

For example, `T_reg = 3600`, `T_ext = 300`, `T_hard = 7200`:

```text
Maximum extensions: floor((7200 - 3600) / 300) = 12 extensions of 5 minutes each
```

An attacker who tries to snipe must arrive at least `T_ext` seconds before the
hard deadline or its deposit will push the deadline out, giving honest voters
time to respond. Each extension also exposes the attacker's deposit size, letting
honest counter-stake calculate the correct response.

Setting `T_ext` too small (e.g., 1 second) makes sniping easy; a last-second
deposit arrives and the extension is trivially short. Setting `T_ext` too large
(equal to `T_reg`) means a single late deposit nearly doubles the registration
window, which may itself be a griefing vector. A range of 5%-15% of `T_reg` is
generally appropriate.

### Reveal window: participation vs. delay

A longer `T_rev` gives registered voters more time to compute and submit their
reveal transaction. The risk of a short `T_rev` is that registered positions
silently miss the reveal deadline and become non-reveals, forfeiting their bond
and, more importantly, inflating `N` in a way that can prevent a legitimate
majority (Part 1).

However, every second of `T_rev` adds directly to the total time from `dispute`
to `Resolved`. The total dispute lifecycle is approximately:

```text
Total dispute time ~= T_hard + T_rev
```

The tradeoff is:

| `T_rev` choice | Effect on default frequency | Effect on finality latency |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Very short (< `t_coord`) | High: reveal coordination may fail | Low |
| Moderate (>= `t_coord`)  | Low: coordinators have time to act | Moderate |
| Very long                | Negligible marginal gain after saturation | High |

Recommended: set `T_rev >= t_coord` with at least a 2x safety margin. For most
disputes, `t_coord` is dominated by off-chain response time (monitoring, human
decision, client submission), not raw transaction throughput. 6 hours to 24 hours
is typical; sub-hour windows risk high default rates unless the deployment
guarantees automated reveal infrastructure.

### Window-length summary table

| Scenario | Longer window helps | Shorter window helps |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| High default frequency | `T_rev` (more reveal time) | n/a |
| Low third-party participation | `T_reg` (more registration time) | n/a |
| Last-second sniping | `T_ext`, `T_hard` | n/a |
| Slow resolution / time-sensitive outcomes | n/a | `T_reg`, `T_rev` |
| Griefing via repeated extensions | n/a | `T_hard` (set conservatively) |

## Part 4: recommended starting profiles

These profiles follow the same three-tier structure as [BOND_SIZING.md](BOND_SIZING.md).
They assume `min_resolution_bond = base_bond` (the contract enforces this). All
time values are in seconds; convert to your deployment's ledger approximation.

### Inputs to collect

Use token units consistently. The v1 inputs (`V_min`, `C_assert`, `C_dispute`,
`R_case`, `K_spam`, `K_dispute`, etc.) still apply to `base_bond`. The additional
v2 inputs are:

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `t_react` | Typical time for an interested third party to notice a dispute and register, in seconds. |
| `t_coord` | Time needed for off-chain reveal coordination: collecting salts, computing commitments, submitting transactions. |
| `N_voters` | Expected number of distinct third-party registrants in a contested dispute. |
| `max_honest_stake` | Expected total third-party honest counter-stake in a typical dispute, in token units. |
| `V_dispute` | Economic value that could be captured by falsely resolving one assertion. |

### Base-bond formula (extending v1)

The v2 minimum bond satisfies all v1 constraints plus one additional check:

```text
base_bond >= max(
  R_case / max(1, K_spam),
  R_case / max(1, K_dispute),
  target_attacker_loss - min(C_assert, C_dispute),
  min_finalizer_reward x 10_000 / max(1, reward_bps),
  V_dispute / capture_cost_multiplier   <- new in v2
)
```

`capture_cost_multiplier` is the minimum multiple of `base_bond` an attacker must
stake to reach majority with no counter-stake. From Part 2, with zero
counter-stake this is `2B + 1`, meaning `capture_cost_multiplier ~= 2`. With
realistic counter-stake the multiplier grows. Use `2` as the conservative
(zero-counter-stake) floor.

Affordability cap (unchanged from v1):

```text
base_bond <= V_min x max_acceptable_bond_share
```

### `max_position` guidance

Set `max_position` as a multiple of `base_bond`:

```text
max_position = k x base_bond,  k in [2, 20]
```

- `k = 2`: a single address cannot reach majority alone (even with no counter-stake).
  Maximally whale-resistant but restricts legitimate large-stake participants.
- `k = 5-10`: a single address needs at least 5-10x honest counter-stake before
  becoming a threat. Suitable for most deployments.
- `k = max_total_weight / base_bond`: no per-position constraint.
  Use only in private / trusted deployments.

### `max_total_weight` guidance and ratio bound reconciliation

```text
max_total_weight = m x base_bond,  where:
  max(10, N_voters x k_avg + 2) <= m <= 10 x k
```

The contract enforces the anti-Sybil ratio bound `m <= 10 x k` (`max_total_weight <= 10 * max_position`) at `initialize`.

**Mathematical Reconciliation with Electorate Size (`N_voters`):**
If every voter were assumed to deposit the full cap `k = max_position / base_bond`, the capacity formula `m >= N_voters * k + 2` together with the ratio bound `m <= 10 * k` would require `N_voters * k + 2 <= 10 * k`, which mathematically forces `N_voters <= 10 - 2/k` (at most 9 full-cap voters).

In real deployments with larger committees (`N_voters > 10`), this is reconciled through:
1. **Average vs. Peak Sizing**: When budgeting for larger committees, size `m` against the expected *average* stake `k_avg x base_bond` (where `k_avg < k`), satisfying `N_voters x k_avg + 2 <= m <= 10 x k`.
2. **Ceiling vs. Whale Trade-Off**:
   - To raise the aggregate counter-stake ceiling `m`, you must raise `k` proportionally (e.g. setting `k = 10` permits `m = 100`, allowing up to 98x `base_bond` of third-party stake; setting `k = 20` permits `m = 200`). The trade-off is that a larger `k` allows a single well-capitalized address to hold a larger individual fraction of total weight.
   - To maximize single-address whale resistance (e.g. `k = 3`), `m` must be capped at `30`, which restricts total third-party counter-stake to roughly 28x `base_bond`.

### Profile table

| Profile | `base_bond` | `T_reg` | `T_ext` | `T_hard` | `T_rev` | `max_position` | `max_total_weight` | Use when |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | -------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Private beta | 1x-2x spam floor | 1-4 h | 5 min | 2x `T_reg` | 4-12 h | 10x `base_bond` | 50x `base_bond` | Known users, coordinated reveals, low bot pressure. |
| Public testnet / low value | 2x-5x larger spam floor | 4-12 h | 10 min | 3x `T_reg` | 12-24 h | 5x `base_bond` | 50x `base_bond` | Open participation, moderate value, expect uncoordinated voters. |
| Higher-value mainnet candidate | 5x+ spam floor, within 5%-20% of `V_min` | 12-24 h | 15-30 min | 2x-4x `T_reg` | 24-48 h | 3x `base_bond` | 30x `base_bond` | Meaningful value, monitored reveals, audited deployment. |

### Narrative guidance per profile

#### Private beta

The electorate is known. Reveals can be coordinated quickly. Default frequency
is low because coordinators will not silently miss the reveal window. The main
risk is a single insider dominating a dispute, so `max_position = 10 x base_bond`
is an informational bound rather than a security control (all participants are
trusted). A 1-4 hour registration window is long enough for beta testers to
notice a dispute; a 4-12 hour reveal window is long enough for manual
coordination. Set `anti_snipe_extension_secs` conservatively at 5 minutes to
prevent last-second test disputes from stalling registration.

#### Public testnet / low value

The electorate is open but economic stakes are low. Default frequency is a
secondary concern because a wrong resolution has limited financial impact.
The primary concern is UX: long enough windows so new users can register and
reveal without requiring dedicated keeper infrastructure, short enough that
resolutions complete within a day or two. A 4-12 hour registration window with
10-minute anti-snipe extensions and a 12-24 hour reveal window is a reasonable
starting point. Set `max_position = 5 x base_bond` to require at least 5 units
of honest counter-stake before a single whale can threaten majority.

#### Higher-value mainnet candidate

Every parameter is tightened toward security. Registration is 12-24 hours to
allow global participation across timezones. The reveal window is 24-48 hours
to give coordinators a full working day to organize reveals. For the profile in the table,
`max_position = 3 x base_bond` with `max_total_weight = 30 x base_bond` forces a whale to recruit
multiple addresses and raises logistics cost, capping single-address weight at 10% of total round
capacity while bounding aggregate third-party counter-stake to roughly 28x `base_bond`. Deployments
prioritizing higher counter-stake ceilings (e.g. 100x–200x `base_bond`) can scale `max_position`
proportionally to 10x–20x `base_bond` to preserve the 10x ratio bound. The anti-snipe extension is longer (15-30 minutes) to give honest
participants meaningful response time to a late deposit. The hard cap is 2-4x
the base registration window to allow 4-8 meaningful extensions without
permitting indefinite delay. The bond floor is computed at 5x+ the v1 spam/dispute
floor, checked against `V_dispute / 2`, and capped at 5%-20% of `V_min`.

---

## Part 5: scenario checks

### Default frequency check

Before launch, verify that a realistic dispute can correct a false assertion.
With your chosen parameters:

1. Assume only the disputer (one `base_bond` against) plus `N_voters` third parties
   each posting `base_bond`.
2. Compute `W = 2 x base_bond x (1 + N_voters / 2)` under a symmetric scenario
   where half the third parties side with each party.
3. Against-side weight: `base_bond x (1 + N_voters / 2)`.
4. Required threshold: strictly more than `W / 2`. The contract uses the
   comparison `side_weight > W - side_weight` rather than `side_weight > W / 2`:
   integer division rounds down, which would wrongly pass a side sitting exactly
   at the boundary on an odd `W`. For an integer `W`, this means against-side
   weight must be at least `floor(W / 2) + 1`.

If `N_voters` is small (e.g., 1), then `W = 3 x base_bond`, against-side weight
is `1.5 x base_bond`, and the required threshold is `floor(3B / 2) + 1`; with
integer bonds, against-side needs at least `floor(3B / 2) + 1` units. For
`base_bond = 2` this is 4 against 3, requiring one more unit on the honest side.
A deployment expecting zero third parties cannot deterministically correct a false
assertion: the disputer's lone bond reaches exactly `W / 2` at `W = 2 x base_bond`,
which does not satisfy `side_weight > W - side_weight`.

**Rule of thumb**: budget `N_voters >= 3` realistically achievable third-party
registrants for a deployment that intends to correct false assertions without
relying on a dominant single voter. Note that `N_voters >= 3` is a floor for a
healthy electorate, not a sufficient condition for correction on its own. The
model above assumes a symmetric split of revealed weight, under which the
against-side weight equals exactly `W / 2` regardless of `N_voters`: correction
always requires an honest-side *imbalance* (more revealed weight against than
for), not just a larger headcount. A deployment with three third-party voters
all revealing on the honest side will correct a false assertion; a deployment
where half reveal for the asserted outcome will not, regardless of how many
participants registered.

### Whale-capture check

For your chosen `base_bond`, `max_position`, and expected `max_honest_stake`:

```text
Minimum capture bond = 2 x base_bond + max_honest_stake + 1 unit
```

If `minimum capture bond > max_position`, capture is impossible for a single
address regardless of counter-stake. If `minimum capture bond <= max_position`,
the whale risk exists and should be controlled by expecting `max_honest_stake`
to be present in contested disputes.

Worked example (higher-value mainnet candidate profile):

- `base_bond = 100` units
- `max_position = 300` units (3x)
- Expected honest counter-stake: `200` units (two third parties at `base_bond` each)

```text
Minimum capture: 2(100) + 200 + 1 = 401 units > max_position (300)
```

A single address cannot reach majority even with no honest counter-stake beyond
the two fixed parties. The deployment is whale-resistant by construction under
this example.

### Window-length sanity check

Verify:

```text
T_rev >= 2 x t_coord   (2x safety margin on reveal coordination)
T_reg >= t_react       (voters can notice and register)
T_ext >= t_atk / 10   (extension is nontrivial relative to attacker response time)
T_hard <= T_reg + 20 x T_ext  (hard cap prevents indefinite extension griefing)
```

If `T_rev < t_coord`, shorten the coordination process, add keeper automation, or
increase `T_rev`. If `T_hard` would exceed your acceptable total dispute lifetime
(`T_hard + T_rev`), tighten the anti-snipe parameters or reduce `T_ext`.

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Review after every testnet campaign and before mainnet launch:

- Fraction of disputes that end in `OptimisticTimeout` vs. `StrictMajority`. A
  high timeout rate with many registered positions suggests the reveal window is
  too short or coordination is breaking down. A high timeout rate with few or no
  third-party registrants may indicate the registration window or bond floor is
  too high for the expected electorate.
- Distribution of `W` across disputes. If `W ~= 2 x base_bond` consistently,
  third-party participation is absent; revisit window lengths and bond sizing.
- Non-reveal rate among registered third-party positions. High non-reveal rates
  inflate `N` and drive default frequency. Investigate whether `T_rev` is too
  short, whether keepers are missing reveals, or whether registrants are
  strategically abstaining.
- `max_position` hits. If deposits are being rejected for exceeding `max_position`,
  either the cap is too tight for the dispute's capital or a whale is probing.
  Examine addresses to distinguish the two.
- Total dispute lifecycle time (from `dispute` to `Resolved`). If disputes are
  consistently completing well inside the maximum window, the windows may safely
  be shortened for future deployments; if they are consistently running to the
  deadline, lengthen the reveal window first.

Raise `base_bond` if capture attempts cluster around small numbers of addresses
or if false assertions survive repeated disputes. Lengthen `T_rev` if the
non-reveal rate is high. Tighten `max_position` if large single-address positions
appear in contested disputes. Revisit the full calculation whenever the token
price, assertion value distribution, or expected electorate changes materially.
