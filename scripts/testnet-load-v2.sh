# Settling and withdrawing the SAME position back to back (rather than

# any leftover floor-division dust is only credited once the settlement
# that brings the winning side's recipient weight up to its full total
# runs, which can easily be a *later* call than some recipient's own
# settlement. An interleaved settle-then-withdraw would let that early
# recipient's withdrawal run before the dust it's entitled to has even
# been credited yet, leaving it stranded in Credit(id, address) instead of
# actually paid out. Settling everyone first, then withdrawing everyone
# once every settlement (including whichever one turns out to be last) has
# already run, avoids that regardless of the shuffle order chosen.
