/** Soroban RPC only retains events for a bounded ledger window (a public
 * RPC endpoint typically keeps on the order of a day's worth on mainnet,
 * more on testnet — the exact figure is an operator setting, not a
 * contract-level constant). A saved cursor (or a computed `startLedger`)
 * that falls outside that window makes `getEvents` fail rather than
 * silently skip ahead, which is exactly the kind of gap this service
 * exists to surface rather than paper over.
 *
 * There's no dedicated error code for this in the JSON-RPC response as of
 * @stellar/stellar-sdk 16.2.0 — it comes back as a generic invocation
 * error, so this is a message-text heuristic. If the RPC provider's wording
 * doesn't match, `fetchNewEvents` still throws (surfaced as a normal
 * `rpc_failure` liveness alert via the poller's consecutive-failure
 * tracking, see poller.ts) — it just isn't distinguished as a gap
 * specifically. Tighten this if you see false negatives/positives against
 * your actual RPC provider's error text.
